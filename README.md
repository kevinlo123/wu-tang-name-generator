## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6 +

When I was building this app, I decided to experiment with what I know and try to take a creative approach as to how I would find my solution.
In HTML created five text inputs where the user would answer the questions provided, and one button that the user would click to generate their name. In JavaScript I created a function that takes in all of the values that the user types into the inputs and converts them into a single string, the value of the length of the string is then stored in a variable.
The function also creates another variable that contains a function that generates a random number. Both of these variables are then stored inside of another variable. The length of this variable is what will determine what name the user recieves.
